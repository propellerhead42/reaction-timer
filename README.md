# reaction-timer

## Reaction Timer as first project in vue3
Covers all the basics from vue3 like:

* Creating multiple Vue Components
* Property Binding with props:
* Lifecycle Hooks
* Custom Event Emiting with Data

You click on Start, after a random time between 2 and 7 seconds, a box appears and a counter starts.
As soon as you click the box, the counter stops and your reaction time plus a ranking string gets displayed.
